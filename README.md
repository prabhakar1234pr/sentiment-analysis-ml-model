# sentiment-analysis-ml-model
## Introduction
This project implements a sentiment analysis model for IMDB movie reviews, leveraging deep learning techniques to classify reviews as positive or negative. The system demonstrates the practical application of natural language processing (NLP) in understanding and categorizing user-generated content, which has significant implications for businesses and researchers in gauging public opinion and customer satisfaction.
##Project Development
The development of this sentiment analysis project followed a structured approach:
Data Preparation: The project began with loading and preprocessing a large dataset of IMDB movie reviews. Multiple CSV files were concatenated to create a comprehensive dataset, with sentiments encoded as binary values (0 for negative, 1 for positive)2
.
Text Preprocessing: A Tokenizer from TensorFlow's Keras API was employed to convert the text data into a format suitable for machine learning. The reviews were tokenized and padded to ensure uniform input size for the neural network2
.
Model Architecture: A Sequential model was designed using TensorFlow, consisting of:
An Embedding layer to create dense vector representations of words
An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer to capture long-range dependencies in the text
A Dense output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification
Training Process: The model was trained using:
Binary cross-entropy as the loss function
Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent
Accuracy as the primary metric
Early stopping to prevent overfitting
TensorBoard integration for performance visualization2
Model Evaluation: The training process included validation splits to monitor the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring generalization2
.
Deployment: Post-training, the model was saved for later use. A Streamlit web application was developed to provide an intuitive interface for users to input reviews and receive real-time sentiment predictions1
.
The project showcases the integration of advanced NLP techniques with modern web technologies, creating a practical tool for sentiment analysis that can be easily used by non-technical users.
